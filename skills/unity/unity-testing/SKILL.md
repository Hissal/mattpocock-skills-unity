# Unity testing

This repo's Unity config (`docs/agents/unity.md`), if present, overrides these defaults, including its **Testing** fields (test assembly layout, mocking library).

This skill decides what to test and what to run: the mode, the test assembly, the tests that cover a change. How a run launches and how to read its result is `unity-verification`'s: call it through the Skill tool for every run. Moving code out of `Assembly-CSharp` is `unity-assemblies`' proposal to make; static state on the production side is `unity-code-lifecycle`'s.

## Mode rule

- **EditMode `[Test]` by default.** It runs synchronously, needs no Play mode, and is the fastest loop.
- **PlayMode** only when the behaviour needs the engine running: the MonoBehaviour lifecycle, frames passing, physics, or a loaded scene.
- **Player tests** only when the user asks.

The mode belongs to the test assembly, not the test: an asmdef with `"includePlatforms": ["Editor"]` holds EditMode tests, any other holds PlayMode tests. Test assemblies, their templates and setting up the first one: [ASSEMBLIES.md](ASSEMBLIES.md). `[UnityTest]`, yield instructions, async tests and scene tests: [UNITYTEST.md](UNITYTEST.md).

## The humble MonoBehaviour

The humble object pattern, Unity's form: logic lives in plain C# classes, tested directly in EditMode; a MonoBehaviour exists only where the engine needs one (a component in a scene, a lifecycle callback, a serialized reference) and forwards to them. A humble MonoBehaviour is too thin to need a test of its own. This is the default seam for Unity code, and the one to offer when agreeing seams.

**The engine as a dependency.** Engine services the logic reads (`Time`, `Input`, `Random`, physics queries) sit behind the repo's own port: an interface the logic takes, a Unity-backed adapter the MonoBehaviour passes in, and a fake the EditMode tests pass in. What only the real engine can show (a collision, a frame's ordering, a scene's wiring) goes to a PlayMode test against the real engine.

**Mocking** uses the library the Unity config names, else hand-written fakes. Whatever the library, put the repo's own interface at the seam and fake that, never a UnityEngine type.

C# versions of `tdd`'s good and bad tests, and of its mocking examples: [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

## EditMode traps

- **No lifecycle.** A plain MonoBehaviour added in an EditMode test gets no `Awake`, `OnEnable`, `Start` or `Update`, not even across `yield return null`. Call its public (or `internal`, with `InternalsVisibleTo`) methods directly, which works, or test it in PlayMode. In PlayMode, `Awake` and `OnEnable` run inside `AddComponent`, and `Start` and `Update` after one `yield return null`.
- **`DestroyImmediate` in EditMode.** `Object.Destroy` there logs "Destroy may not be called from edit mode!", leaves the object alive, and fails the test. In PlayMode `Destroy` is deferred: the object is still non-null until the next frame.
- **Any unexpected error log fails the test**, `Debug.LogError`, an exception log and an assertion log alike. A test that expects one calls `LogAssert.Expect(LogType.Error, "<message or Regex>")` before the code that logs: Unity documents the check running at the end of each frame, so an expectation placed after a yield comes too late.
- **Cleanup beyond Undo.** The EditMode runner opens a fresh scene and afterwards reverts Undo-recorded changes, which covers little: GameObjects a test creates are destroyed in its `[TearDown]`, and files, assets and settings it writes are deleted or restored by it too.

## Static state in tests

Write tests as if domain reload is off, whatever the project setting, unless the user or the Unity config says it does not matter: reset every static the test touches in `[SetUp]`, and never rely on a fresh domain between tests. Tests in one run share one domain: a static set in one EditMode test is still set in the next. With reload off, expect statics to outlive the run too (not yet checked for PlayMode test runs). The reason, and the production side (giving each static a reset path), are `unity-code-lifecycle`'s: a suite that already resets its statics survives a switch to reload off, or to CoreCLR, with no migration.

## What tests cannot judge

Feel, visuals, audio and timing that a human perceives are out of a test's reach. Extract the testable logic from under them (the jump curve's numbers, the state that picks the sound), test that, and hand the rest to `unity-verification`'s report as concrete manual checks: what to open, what to do, what to look or listen for.

## Choosing tests

- **During the loop**: the test assemblies of the module being changed, only.
- **Before calling the change done**: the full EditMode suite, once.
- **PlayMode**: when the change touches lifecycle, physics or scene code, or the module already has PlayMode tests.

Pass these to `unity-verification` as the assemblies or fixtures to run; the filter syntax is its concern.

## Run cadence

`tdd`'s "one slice at a time" holds: each slice is one seam, one test and one minimal implementation. What changes in Unity is how slices share a run, never a cycle.

- **With a connected editor** (`com.unity.pipeline`), runs are cheap: run plain one-slice red/green cycles, exactly as `tdd` writes them.
- **When each run is a cold headless launch**, editor startup dominates. Batch independent slices (neither touches the other's code or behaviour): one run shows the batch red, one shows it green, and a green run may carry the next batch's red tests.
- **The red run is never dropped**, batched or not: it is what exposes a tautological test.
- **Dependent slices stay sequential**: a slice whose test or code builds on another's waits for that one's green.

## Sketching test seams for a spec

For each behaviour, name the plain C# class that owns it and its EditMode `[Test]` seam; mark as PlayMode only what needs the engine running (per the mode rule); name each engine service that needs a port; and list what tests cannot judge as manual checks.

## Friction signals

When scanning Unity code for architectural friction, the signals this skill owns: logic stuck in MonoBehaviours, out of EditMode's reach; and scene lookups (`Find*`, `FindObjectOfType`) standing in for dependencies that could be passed in. Report where they are; changing the design is the user's call.

## Reviewing test changes

Check each changed test against every EditMode trap and the static and mocking rules above, and each changed test assembly for:

- a test asmdef beside its tests, with the mode its tests need (EditMode `includePlatforms: ["Editor"]` for anything using `UnityEditor`), in the layout of [ASSEMBLIES.md](ASSEMBLIES.md);
- production code in a test assembly (it never reaches the Player).

## Validation

Name the tests per **Choosing tests**, then call the Skill tool with "unity-verification" to run them and report. A new test assembly adds the checks in [ASSEMBLIES.md](ASSEMBLIES.md).
