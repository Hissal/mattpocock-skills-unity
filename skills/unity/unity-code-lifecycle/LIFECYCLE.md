# Code lifecycle reference

## The eight lifecycle attributes (6.5 and later)

Each goes on a static, parameterless, `void` method. None exists before 6.5.

| Attribute | Namespace | Fires | Older API it replaces |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[OnCodeLoaded]` | `Unity.Scripting.LifecycleManagement` | After assemblies load: initial load (Editor and Player), and after each code reload (Editor) | None |
| `[OnCodeInitializing]` | `Unity.Scripting.LifecycleManagement` | After managed objects are deserialized, before `Awake`/`OnEnable`; on initial load, before the first scene loads | `[InitializeOnLoad]`, `[InitializeOnLoadMethod]` (and `SubsystemRegistration` as a load hook, see below) |
| `[OnCodeDeinitializing]` | `Unity.Scripting.LifecycleManagement` | Before managed objects are serialized for a code reload | None |
| `[OnCodeUnloading]` | `Unity.Scripting.LifecycleManagement` | Before assemblies unload for a code reload, and on shutdown | `AssemblyReloadEvents.beforeAssemblyReload` |
| `[OnEnteringPlayMode]` | `UnityEngine` | Entering Play mode, after a code reload in Play mode, and at Player startup | `PlayModeStateChange.EnteredPlayMode`; timing of `[InitializeOnEnterPlayMode]`; `SubsystemRegistration` as a per-Play reset |
| `[OnExitingPlayMode]` | `UnityEngine` | Exiting Play mode, before a code reload in Play mode, and before Player quit | `PlayModeStateChange.ExitingPlayMode` |
| `[OnEnteringEditMode]` | `UnityEditor.Scripting.LifecycleManagement` | Returning to Edit mode, and after a code reload in Edit mode | `PlayModeStateChange.EnteredEditMode` |
| `[OnExitingEditMode]` | `UnityEditor.Scripting.LifecycleManagement` | Before entering Play mode, and before a code reload in Edit mode | `PlayModeStateChange.ExitingEditMode` |

The Play mode pair lives in `UnityEngine`, so runtime scripts use it without `#if UNITY_EDITOR`, and it runs in players too. The Edit mode pair is Editor-only.

**`SubsystemRegistration` has two replacements.** Unity's 6.6 API page for it says "For new code, use OnCodeInitializingAttribute instead", a mapping by load timing. But with domain reload off, `[OnCodeInitializing]` never fires on entering Play mode, while `SubsystemRegistration` fires on every Play entry. So a `SubsystemRegistration` method that resets statics moves to `[OnEnteringPlayMode]` (or `[AutoStaticsCleanup]`); moving it to `[OnCodeInitializing]` brings back every second-Play bug it was there to prevent. Code that needs a specific load point (before or after the first scene loads) keeps its `RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod` load type, which also fires on every Play entry.

## What fires on a Play session

| Fires on every Play entry, reload on or off | Fires only when code actually reloads |
|---|---|
| `[OnExitingEditMode]`, `[OnEnteringPlayMode]`, `[OnExitingPlayMode]`, `[OnEnteringEditMode]`, the `[AutoStaticsCleanup]` reset, `[InitializeOnEnterPlayMode]`, every `RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod` load type | `[OnCodeLoaded]`, `[OnCodeInitializing]`, `[OnCodeDeinitializing]`, `[OnCodeUnloading]`, `[InitializeOnLoad]`, `[InitializeOnLoadMethod]`, `AssemblyReloadEvents` |

Exiting Play mode never reloads code, with either setting.

## Observed orders

Entering Play mode, reload off:

1. `[OnExitingEditMode]`, `playModeStateChanged(ExitingEditMode)`, `[InitializeOnEnterPlayMode]`
2. The `[AutoStaticsCleanup]` reset
3. `[OnEnteringPlayMode]` (the first callback with `Application.isPlaying` true)
4. `SubsystemRegistration`, `AfterAssembliesLoaded`, `BeforeSplashScreen`, `BeforeSceneLoad`, `Awake`, `OnEnable`, `AfterSceneLoad`, `Start`, `playModeStateChanged(EnteredPlayMode)`

With reload on, a full code reload (`[OnCodeDeinitializing]`, `[OnCodeUnloading]`, then `[InitializeOnLoad]`, `[OnCodeLoaded]`, `[InitializeOnEnterPlayMode]`, `[OnCodeInitializing]`, `[InitializeOnLoadMethod]`) runs between steps 1 and 3.

Exiting Play mode: `playModeStateChanged(ExitingPlayMode)`, `[OnExitingPlayMode]`, the `[AutoStaticsCleanup]` reset, `[OnEnteringEditMode]`, `playModeStateChanged(EnteredEditMode)`.

Windows release player, startup to quit: `[OnCodeLoaded]`, `[OnCodeInitializing]`, `[OnEnteringPlayMode]`, `SubsystemRegistration`, `AfterAssembliesLoaded`, `BeforeSceneLoad`, `Awake`, `AfterSceneLoad`, `Start`, then on `Application.Quit`: `OnApplicationQuit`, `[OnExitingPlayMode]`, `[OnCodeUnloading]`. `[OnCodeLoaded]` runs before the engine is ready there: calling `Time.frameCount` from it crashed the player.

The reset is itself registered as a lifecycle callback, so its place among the callbacks on the same transition is an observation, not a documented order.

## `[AutoStaticsCleanup]` details

- Takes no arguments: there is no enter-only or exit-only form.
- A `static readonly` collection's initializer must be omitted, `new()`, or the exact declared type.
- A `<asmdefName>.globalconfig` can turn generation off (`build_property.UnityEnableAutoStaticsCleanupCodeGen`) or the UAL analyzer on (`build_property.UnityEnableAutoStaticsCleanupAnalysis`); the analyzer flags a static constructor next to cleaned members as `UAL0014`.

## Pre-6.5 mapping

| Need | Before 6.5 |
|---|---|
| Reset runtime statics on each Play entry | `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod(RuntimeInitializeLoadType.SubsystemRegistration)]` |
| Reset Editor statics on each Play entry | `[InitializeOnEnterPlayMode]` (Editor-only, optionally taking `EnterPlayModeOptions`) |
| Run Editor code on load and after each recompile | `[InitializeOnLoad]` static constructor, `[InitializeOnLoadMethod]` |
| Run Editor code before a code reload | `AssemblyReloadEvents.beforeAssemblyReload` |
| React to Play and Edit mode changes in Editor code | `EditorApplication.playModeStateChanged` |

A fallback reset assigns every static back by hand, event fields included (`= null`).
